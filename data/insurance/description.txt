To find patterns related to customers with high property cost, we set
the evidence to "PropertyCost=Million" and the threshold to 0.015.   

probability(0.015)
evidence(PropertyCost=Million)

We obtain 12 patterns, most of which contain assignments
"SeniorTrain=False" or "Theft=Flase". We exclude these variables, as
we are not interested in them.

exclude(SeniorTrain)
exclude(Theft)

Lowering the threshold to 0.0105, we obtain 76 solutions, on of which
is {"PropertyCost=Million", "DrivingSkill=Substandard", "DrivQuality=Poor"
"LiabilityCost=Thousand"}. This pattern is overspecified, since the
second assignment implies the third. We can discard overspecified patterns:

free(0)

Then this pattern is discarded and we will have the simpler pattern
{"PropertyCost=Million", "DrivingSkill=Poor",
"LiabilityCost=Thousand"} which has the same
probability. Alternatively, we might want to see what else is almost
implied by that pattern, using the delta-closed constraint:

delta-closed(0.005)

Then again that pattern is discarded, but this time we will have a
longer pattern with the extra assignment
"OtherCarCost=HundredThousand".
